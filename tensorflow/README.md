# YOLO - v3

Example of YOLO v3 implementation in TnesorFlow 2.

# Notes
* The folder ``tensoflow`` is a partial clone of this [repository](https://github.com/ethanyanjiali/deep-vision). The repository is quite large, with several other algorithm. I only took the YOLO algorithm, hence the *partial*. The author wrote a blog post about his code: *Dive Really Deep into YOLO v3: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide* [[Medium]](https://medium.com/@ethanyanjiali/dive-really-deep-into-yolo-v3-a-beginners-guide-9e3d2666280e) [[Personal Blog]](https://yanjia.li/dive-really-deep-into-yolo-v3-a-beginners-guide/).
* The ``Datasets`` folder is also a partial clone from this [repository](https://github.com/ethanyanjiali/deep-vision). Check README.md for more info.
